# Akina Productions

This is the beginning of my personal portfolio of all the projects that I've done and will do for the next 5 months. This will keep them all in order and give easy access to anyone that wishes to view them.

Below is what my portfolio looks like, and [here]() is the link drectly to it. Take a look!

I looked at code from previous projects and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) at certain points I got stuck, and copied some bits as a baseline. I then changed the code around to work for my portfolio.
